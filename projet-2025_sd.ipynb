        "## TODO\n",
        "\n",
        "Building on the notebooks we've seen during the lectures and on the tipcs below, you task is to build two tagging models:\n",
        "1. a RNN-based model: an embedding layer, a LSTM layer, a feed-forward layer\n",
        "2. a fine-tuned BERT tagger: a BERT (pre-trained) layer, a feed-forward layer\n",
        "The final feed-forward layer procudes a probability distribution over the set possible tags for each input token.\n",
        "\n",
        "For both, we will use BERT's tokenizer, which is a sub-word tokenizer. The advantage of this tokenizer is that the vocabulary is finite (no out-of-vocabulary tokens): you can get the vocabulary size from tokenizer.vocab_size and you don't have to bother with defining your vocabulary and mapping unkown tokens to some special token. The disadvantage of sub-word tokenization is that we will have to relabel the input sequences, which are labeled on a word basis rather than on a sub-word basis. To make things easier, we provide a function that aligns and encode the labels. Note that special tokens will arbitrarily get the tag -100 which is a default value to indicate Torch's loss functions that gradient should not be propagated from there (in other words, ignore thos tokens in training).\n",
        "\n",
        "Another advantage of using the same tokenizer is that you will have to prepare your dataset and the corresponding loaders only once for the two models.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here are the steps you'll have to go through:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Define a Dataset class that will hold for each sample the list of encoded tokens and the corresponding list of encoded tags. You will then encode the three folds as a Dataset and define the corresponding DataLoader instances.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Define your LSTM model class and train it. You can get inspired by the RNN language model notebook.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Define your BERT model class and train it. You can adapt the LLM finetuning notebook, changing the classification head to operate on each token (as for the LSTM) rather than on the embedding of the [CLS] token.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Evaluate both and compare. Token tag accuracy is one measure (used for instance to measure the convergence of training) but it's not the ultimate one as the final task is not to tag tokens but to detect entities. You should thus also report in the final evaluation the entitu recognition rate.\n",
        "\n",
        "One last thing to think about: computation of the accuracy for validation and testing must be adapted in two ways compared to what we've seen in the previous notebooks. First, each prediction is a sequence of tags and not a single tag. Second, tags corresponding to the special tokens (indicated as -100 in the reference) must not be accounted for when computing the accuracy (maybe pytorch does that for you but you have to make sure it does).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Good luck no your mission!**\n",
        "\n",
        "## REPORT\n",

        "The report will be a commented notebook. This is not a python programing project but a NLP project. I'm thus expecting you to comment on your model definition choices, to analyze the results and errors, to provide hints at how things could be improved.
